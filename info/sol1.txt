Act as Data Engineer working on a ETL solution with upstream ETL implemented with Step Function workflow to run the AWS Glue to perform the data movement from the Guidewire SaaS S3 bucket through enterprise data lake bucket o Snowflake Base Data Layer and Event Bridge Scheduler used for schedule of the workflow, the control process records maintained in Dynamo DB Colelction.
The Down stream data movement from base layer to semantic layer is implemented with DBT ELT an Falsk app with simple rest api runs on AWS EKS exposed rest api being invoked by Lambda which further would be invoked by an Downstream Step Function work flow. Now the ask is to design and build a Trigger schedule mechanism for this step function and provide Pros and Cons of the trigger built using one of the below approach

1) Upstream workflow --> Event Bridge push a event --> Intermediate new Step Function listen and respond to the event by triggering the downstream step function
2) Event Bridge Scheduler with CRON schedule(eg: every 15 minutes) --> Intermediate new Step Function listen and respond to the event by triggering the downstream step function
3) Upstream step function workflow on successful ETL Run complete add the final step to invoke -->  the downstream step function directly called from the upstream step function
4) Upstream workflow --> Event Bridge push a event --> New Lambda listens for the event and --> invoke the downstream step function directly called from the Lambda
Consider Step Function is region specific and need to consider the 2 active-passive deployment of the upstream ELT aws components and the downstream ELT DBT APP in EKS both regions

Design and Build Trigger Schedule Mechanism
Overview
In this scenario, you need to design a mechanism to trigger the downstream Step Function workflow. The goal is to ensure that this mechanism is efficient, reliable, and integrates well with your existing architecture.

Approach Analysis
Let's analyze the given approaches based on the following criteria:

Simplicity: How straightforward the implementation is.
Reliability: The ability to handle failures and ensure the downstream workflow is triggered appropriately.
Scalability: Ability to handle increased loads without significant changes.
Maintainability: Ease of managing and updating the solution.
Latency: Time taken from the completion of the upstream workflow to the triggering of the downstream workflow.
Approach 1: Event Bridge Push with Intermediate Step Function
Workflow: Upstream workflow → Event Bridge → Intermediate Step Function → Downstream Step Function
Pros:
Decoupling: Separates the upstream and downstream processes, making the system modular.
Flexibility: Easy to add more processing logic in the intermediate step function if needed.
Cons:
Complexity: Adds an additional layer of Step Functions, which increases complexity.
Latency: Slight increase due to the additional intermediate step.
Approach 2: Event Bridge Scheduler with CRON Schedule
Workflow: Event Bridge Scheduler (CRON) → Intermediate Step Function → Downstream Step Function
Pros:
Simplicity: Straightforward to implement using scheduled events.
Predictability: Runs at regular intervals, ensuring periodic updates.
Cons:
Latency: Fixed schedule might not be optimal; could lead to delays.
Resource Consumption: May trigger unnecessary executions if there are no updates in the upstream data.
Approach 3: Direct Invocation from Upstream Step Function
Workflow: Upstream Step Function → Downstream Step Function
Pros:
Low Latency: Immediate triggering of the downstream workflow upon completion of the upstream process.
Simplicity: Direct and easy to manage.
Cons:
Tight Coupling: Increases dependency between upstream and downstream workflows, reducing modularity.
Error Handling: Any failure in the downstream process could affect the upstream workflow.
Approach 4: Event Bridge Push with Lambda
Workflow: Upstream workflow → Event Bridge → Lambda → Downstream Step Function
Pros:
Decoupling: Keeps the upstream and downstream workflows separate.
Flexibility: Lambda function allows for complex processing before triggering the downstream step function.
Cons:
Lambda Limitations: Subject to Lambda’s execution time limits and resource constraints.
Complexity: Additional layer of Lambda function increases complexity.
Recommended Approach
Considering the criteria and the need for an active-passive deployment, Approach 4 seems to be the most balanced option:

Event Bridge Push with Lambda:
Decoupling: Ensures the upstream and downstream processes are modular.
Flexibility: Allows for pre-processing and complex logic in Lambda before triggering the downstream step function.
Error Handling: Easier to manage retries and error handling within Lambda.
Scalability: Can scale as required by AWS Lambda and EventBridge's native capabilities.
Deployment Considerations for Active-Passive Regions
Cross-Region Event Handling: Ensure EventBridge and Lambda are configured to handle events across regions. AWS EventBridge can route events between different regions.
Failover Mechanism: Implement a failover mechanism where if the active region fails, the passive region can take over the processing.
Data Consistency: Ensure data consistency between active and passive regions, especially in DynamoDB and S3 buckets.
Final Design
Upstream Workflow: Completes ETL process and pushes an event to EventBridge.
EventBridge: Listens for specific events and routes them to the appropriate Lambda function.
Lambda Function: Processes the event and triggers the downstream Step Function workflow.
Downstream Step Function: Executes the ELT process using DBT and updates the semantic layer.
By following this design, you ensure a robust, scalable, and maintainable solution that aligns with AWS best practices.

Handling ETL Process Failures in Downstream ELT
Handling ETL process failures in the downstream ELT is crucial for ensuring data consistency and reliability. Each approach must include mechanisms for error detection, recovery, and rerun capabilities.

Approach 1: Event Bridge Push with Intermediate Step Function
Workflow: Upstream workflow → Event Bridge → Intermediate Step Function → Downstream Step Function

Error Handling:
Step Function Error Handling: Use Step Function's built-in retry and catch mechanisms to handle transient errors and retries.
State Tracking: Track execution states in DynamoDB. On failure, log error details and mark the run as failed.
Notification: Send notifications (e.g., SNS or CloudWatch Alarms) on failures.
Recovery and Rerun:
Manual Rerun: Administrators can manually trigger the rerun by invoking the intermediate step function.
Automated Rerun: Configure a retry policy in the Step Function to retry the downstream workflow after a certain period.
Data Consistency: Ensure data consistency checks in the intermediate step function before triggering reruns.
Practical Feasibility:

Simplicity: Moderately complex due to the additional Step Function.
Reliability: High, with built-in retry mechanisms and error tracking.
Maintainability: Requires managing state tracking and retry policies.
Latency: Slight increase due to the intermediate step but acceptable for most use cases.
Approach 2: Event Bridge Scheduler with CRON Schedule
Workflow: Event Bridge Scheduler (CRON) → Intermediate Step Function → Downstream Step Function

Error Handling:
Scheduled Checks: The intermediate step function can include logic to check for the completion status of previous runs before starting a new run.
Failure Logging: Log failures and execution status in DynamoDB.
Notification: Send alerts on failures.
Recovery and Rerun:
Scheduled Retry: The next scheduled run can include logic to retry failed executions.
Manual Intervention: Administrators can manually trigger the intermediate step function if necessary.
Data Validation: Include validation steps in the intermediate step function to ensure data consistency.
Practical Feasibility:

Simplicity: Easy to implement with CRON schedules.
Reliability: Dependent on the frequency of the CRON schedule; may have delays in recovery.
Maintainability: Simple to manage but requires careful handling of scheduled retries.
Latency: Fixed interval may lead to unnecessary executions or delayed recovery.
Approach 3: Direct Invocation from Upstream Step Function
Workflow: Upstream Step Function → Downstream Step Function

Error Handling:
Catch and Retry: Use catch and retry mechanisms within the upstream step function for the downstream invocation.
Error Logging: Log errors and execution details in DynamoDB.
Notification: Trigger notifications on failure.
Recovery and Rerun:
Automatic Retry: Configure retries within the upstream step function.
Manual Rerun: Administrators can re-trigger the upstream step function if necessary.
Consistency Checks: Ensure data consistency before rerunning the downstream workflow.
Practical Feasibility:

Simplicity: Simple with direct invocation but tightly coupled.
Reliability: High due to built-in retries but can be impacted if the downstream process fails frequently.
Maintainability: Requires managing complex error handling within a single step function.
Latency: Low latency due to direct invocation.
Approach 4: Event Bridge Push with Lambda
Workflow: Upstream workflow → Event Bridge → Lambda → Downstream Step Function

Error Handling:
Lambda Error Handling: Use AWS Lambda's retry mechanisms and dead-letter queues (DLQ) to capture failed events.
Error Logging: Log errors and execution status in DynamoDB.
Notification: Send notifications via SNS or CloudWatch Alarms on Lambda or downstream failures.
Recovery and Rerun:
Lambda Retry: Configure retry policies for Lambda, including exponential backoff strategies.
DLQ Processing: Automatically or manually process messages in DLQ to retry failed executions.
Manual Rerun: Administrators can re-invoke the Lambda function if needed.
Data Consistency: Perform validation checks within Lambda before re-triggering the downstream workflow.
Practical Feasibility:

Simplicity: Moderate complexity due to the Lambda function.
Reliability: High with Lambda's built-in retries and DLQ.
Maintainability: Requires managing Lambda functions and DLQ processing.
Latency: Low latency with immediate event processing.
Recommended Approach with Failure Handling
Considering error handling, recovery, and rerun capabilities, Approach 4: Event Bridge Push with Lambda is recommended:

EventBridge pushes an event to notify the completion of the upstream ETL process.
Lambda function listens for the EventBridge event, logs execution status in DynamoDB, and triggers the downstream Step Function.
Error Handling:
Lambda retries on failure with exponential backoff.
Use DLQ for capturing failed events for further analysis and rerun.
Recovery:
Automated retries configured within Lambda.
Manual intervention for DLQ processing and rerun.
Consistency checks within Lambda before triggering the downstream workflow.
This approach offers a good balance of simplicity, reliability, and maintainability, making it a practical choice for the ETL process with failure handling and recovery capabilities.
