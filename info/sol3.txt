Act as Data Engineer working on a ETL solution with upstream ETL implemented with Step Function workflow to run the AWS Glue to perform the data movement from the Guidewire SaaS S3 bucket through enterprise data lake bucket o Snowflake Base Data Layer and Event Bridge Scheduler used for schedule of the workflow, the control process records maintained in Dynamo DB Colelction.
The Down stream data movement from base layer to semantic layer is implemented with DBT ELT an Falsk app with simple rest api runs on AWS EKS exposed rest api being invoked by Lambda which further would be invoked by an Downstream Step Function work flow. Now the ask is to design and build a Trigger schedule mechanism for this step function and provide Pros and Cons of the trigger built using one of the below approach

1) Upstream workflow --> Event Bridge push a event --> Intermediate new Step Function listen and respond to the event by triggering the downstream step function
2) Event Bridge Scheduler with CRON schedule(eg: every 15 minutes) --> Intermediate new Step Function listen and respond to the event by triggering the downstream step function
3) Upstream step function workflow on successful ETL Run complete add the final step to invoke -->  the downstream step function directly called from the upstream step function
4) Upstream workflow --> Event Bridge push a event --> New Lambda listens for the event and --> invoke the downstream step function directly called from the Lambda
Consider Step Function is region specific and need to consider the 2 active-passive deployment of the upstream ELT aws components and the downstream ELT DBT APP in EKS both regions

Design and Build Trigger Schedule Mechanism
Overview
In this scenario, you need to design a mechanism to trigger the downstream Step Function workflow. The goal is to ensure that this mechanism is efficient, reliable, and integrates well with your existing architecture.

Approach Analysis
Let's analyze the given approaches based on the following criteria:

Simplicity: How straightforward the implementation is.
Reliability: The ability to handle failures and ensure the downstream workflow is triggered appropriately.
Scalability: Ability to handle increased loads without significant changes.
Maintainability: Ease of managing and updating the solution.
Latency: Time taken from the completion of the upstream workflow to the triggering of the downstream workflow.
Approach 1: Event Bridge Push with Intermediate Step Function
Workflow: Upstream workflow → Event Bridge → Intermediate Step Function → Downstream Step Function
Pros:
Decoupling: Separates the upstream and downstream processes, making the system modular.
Flexibility: Easy to add more processing logic in the intermediate step function if needed.
Cons:
Complexity: Adds an additional layer of Step Functions, which increases complexity.
Latency: Slight increase due to the additional intermediate step.
Approach 2: Event Bridge Scheduler with CRON Schedule
Workflow: Event Bridge Scheduler (CRON) → Intermediate Step Function → Downstream Step Function
Pros:
Simplicity: Straightforward to implement using scheduled events.
Predictability: Runs at regular intervals, ensuring periodic updates.
Cons:
Latency: Fixed schedule might not be optimal; could lead to delays.
Resource Consumption: May trigger unnecessary executions if there are no updates in the upstream data.
Approach 3: Direct Invocation from Upstream Step Function
Workflow: Upstream Step Function → Downstream Step Function
Pros:
Low Latency: Immediate triggering of the downstream workflow upon completion of the upstream process.
Simplicity: Direct and easy to manage.
Cons:
Tight Coupling: Increases dependency between upstream and downstream workflows, reducing modularity.
Error Handling: Any failure in the downstream process could affect the upstream workflow.
Approach 4: Event Bridge Push with Lambda
Workflow: Upstream workflow → Event Bridge → Lambda → Downstream Step Function
Pros:
Decoupling: Keeps the upstream and downstream workflows separate.
Flexibility: Lambda function allows for complex processing before triggering the downstream step function.
Cons:
Lambda Limitations: Subject to Lambda’s execution time limits and resource constraints.
Complexity: Additional layer of Lambda function increases complexity.
Recommended Approach
Considering the criteria and the need for an active-passive deployment, Approach 4 seems to be the most balanced option:

Event Bridge Push with Lambda:
Decoupling: Ensures the upstream and downstream processes are modular.
Flexibility: Allows for pre-processing and complex logic in Lambda before triggering the downstream step function.
Error Handling: Easier to manage retries and error handling within Lambda.
Scalability: Can scale as required by AWS Lambda and EventBridge's native capabilities.
Deployment Considerations for Active-Passive Regions
Cross-Region Event Handling: Ensure EventBridge and Lambda are configured to handle events across regions. AWS EventBridge can route events between different regions.
Failover Mechanism: Implement a failover mechanism where if the active region fails, the passive region can take over the processing.
Data Consistency: Ensure data consistency between active and passive regions, especially in DynamoDB and S3 buckets.
Final Design
Upstream Workflow: Completes ETL process and pushes an event to EventBridge.
EventBridge: Listens for specific events and routes them to the appropriate Lambda function.
Lambda Function: Processes the event and triggers the downstream Step Function workflow.
Downstream Step Function: Executes the ELT process using DBT and updates the semantic layer.
By following this design, you ensure a robust, scalable, and maintainable solution that aligns with AWS best practices.

Handling ETL Process Failures in Downstream ELT
Handling ETL process failures in the downstream ELT is crucial for ensuring data consistency and reliability. Each approach must include mechanisms for error detection, recovery, and rerun capabilities.

Approach 1: Event Bridge Push with Intermediate Step Function
Workflow: Upstream workflow → Event Bridge → Intermediate Step Function → Downstream Step Function

Error Handling:
Step Function Error Handling: Use Step Function's built-in retry and catch mechanisms to handle transient errors and retries.
State Tracking: Track execution states in DynamoDB. On failure, log error details and mark the run as failed.
Notification: Send notifications (e.g., SNS or CloudWatch Alarms) on failures.
Recovery and Rerun:
Manual Rerun: Administrators can manually trigger the rerun by invoking the intermediate step function.
Automated Rerun: Configure a retry policy in the Step Function to retry the downstream workflow after a certain period.
Data Consistency: Ensure data consistency checks in the intermediate step function before triggering reruns.
Practical Feasibility:

Simplicity: Moderately complex due to the additional Step Function.
Reliability: High, with built-in retry mechanisms and error tracking.
Maintainability: Requires managing state tracking and retry policies.
Latency: Slight increase due to the intermediate step but acceptable for most use cases.
Approach 2: Event Bridge Scheduler with CRON Schedule
Workflow: Event Bridge Scheduler (CRON) → Intermediate Step Function → Downstream Step Function

Error Handling:
Scheduled Checks: The intermediate step function can include logic to check for the completion status of previous runs before starting a new run.
Failure Logging: Log failures and execution status in DynamoDB.
Notification: Send alerts on failures.
Recovery and Rerun:
Scheduled Retry: The next scheduled run can include logic to retry failed executions.
Manual Intervention: Administrators can manually trigger the intermediate step function if necessary.
Data Validation: Include validation steps in the intermediate step function to ensure data consistency.
Practical Feasibility:

Simplicity: Easy to implement with CRON schedules.
Reliability: Dependent on the frequency of the CRON schedule; may have delays in recovery.
Maintainability: Simple to manage but requires careful handling of scheduled retries.
Latency: Fixed interval may lead to unnecessary executions or delayed recovery.

Workflow: Upstream Step Function → Downstream Step Function

Error Handling:
Catch and Retry: Use catch and retry mechanisms within the upstream step function for the downstream invocation.
Error Logging: Log errors and execution details in DynamoDB.
Notification: Trigger notifications on failure.
Recovery and Rerun:
Automatic Retry: Configure retries within the upstream step function.
Manual Rerun: Administrators can re-trigger the upstream step function if necessary.
Consistency Checks: Ensure data consistency before rerunning the downstream workflow.
Practical Feasibility:

Simplicity: Simple with direct invocation but tightly coupled.
Reliability: High due to built-in retries but can be impacted if the downstream process fails frequently.
Maintainability: Requires managing complex error handling within a single step function.
Latency: Low latency due to direct invocation.
Approach 4: Event Bridge Push with Lambda
Workflow: Upstream workflow → Event Bridge → Lambda → Downstream Step Function

Error Handling:
Lambda Error Handling: Use AWS Lambda's retry mechanisms and dead-letter queues (DLQ) to capture failed events.
Error Logging: Log errors and execution status in DynamoDB.
Notification: Send notifications via SNS or CloudWatch Alarms on Lambda or downstream failures.
Recovery and Rerun:
Lambda Retry: Configure retry policies for Lambda, including exponential backoff strategies.
DLQ Processing: Automatically or manually process messages in DLQ to retry failed executions.
Manual Rerun: Administrators can re-invoke the Lambda function if needed.
Data Consistency: Perform validation checks within Lambda before re-triggering the downstream workflow.
Practical Feasibility:

Simplicity: Moderate complexity due to the Lambda function.
Reliability: High with Lambda's built-in retries and DLQ.
Maintainability: Requires managing Lambda functions and DLQ processing.
Latency: Low latency with immediate event processing.
Recommended Approach with Failure Handling
Considering error handling, recovery, and rerun capabilities, Approach 4: Event Bridge Push with Lambda is recommended:

EventBridge pushes an event to notify the completion of the upstream ETL process.
Lambda function listens for the EventBridge event, logs execution status in DynamoDB, and triggers the downstream Step Function.
Error Handling:
Lambda retries on failure with exponential backoff.
Use DLQ for capturing failed events for further analysis and rerun.
Recovery:
Automated retries configured within Lambda.
Manual intervention for DLQ processing and rerun.
Consistency checks within Lambda before triggering the downstream workflow.
This approach offers a good balance of simplicity, reliability, and maintainability, making it a practical choice for the ETL process with failure handling and recovery capabilities.

provide a simple steop function state definition how the below can be achived provide the step function state definition json
Data Consistency: Ensure data consistency checks are incorporated within the Step Function
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
To ensure data consistency checks within the Step Function, you can incorporate a state to validate the data before proceeding with the rest of the workflow. This can be done using a combination of Lambda functions and built-in Step Functions states such as Choice and Fail.

Here is a simple example of a Step Function state definition JSON that includes a data consistency check:

json
Copy code
{
  "Comment": "A Step Function to process ETL with data consistency check",
  "StartAt": "DataConsistencyCheck",
  "States": {
    "DataConsistencyCheck": {
      "Type": "Task",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:function:DataConsistencyCheckFunction",
      "Next": "CheckConsistencyResult"
    },
    "CheckConsistencyResult": {
      "Type": "Choice",
      "Choices": [
        {
          "Variable": "$.consistencyStatus",
          "StringEquals": "SUCCESS",
          "Next": "ProcessData"
        },
        {
          "Variable": "$.consistencyStatus",
          "StringEquals": "FAILED",
          "Next": "DataInconsistencyHandler"
        }
      ],
      "Default": "DataInconsistencyHandler"
    },
    "DataInconsistencyHandler": {
      "Type": "Fail",
      "Error": "DataInconsistencyError",
      "Cause": "Data consistency check failed."
    },
    "ProcessData": {
      "Type": "Task",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:function:ProcessDataFunction",
      "End": true
    }
  }
}
Explanation:
DataConsistencyCheck:

Type: Task
Resource: A Lambda function (DataConsistencyCheckFunction) that performs the data consistency check.
Next: Directs the workflow to CheckConsistencyResult.
CheckConsistencyResult:

Type: Choice
Evaluates the result of the data consistency check.
Choices:
If $.consistencyStatus is "SUCCESS", the workflow proceeds to ProcessData.
If $.consistencyStatus is "FAILED", the workflow proceeds to DataInconsistencyHandler.
Default: If no conditions match, it defaults to DataInconsistencyHandler.
DataInconsistencyHandler:

Type: Fail
Error: Custom error message DataInconsistencyError.
Cause: Reason for the failure, "Data consistency check failed.".
ProcessData:

Type: Task
Resource: A Lambda function (ProcessDataFunction) that processes the data if the consistency check is successful.
End: Marks the end of the workflow.
Data Consistency Check Lambda Function
The DataConsistencyCheckFunction Lambda function should return a result with the consistencyStatus field set to either "SUCCESS" or "FAILED". Here’s a simple example of what the Lambda function might look like:

python
Copy code
import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Implement your data consistency check logic here
    consistency_check_passed = perform_data_consistency_check()

    if consistency_check_passed:
        return {
            "consistencyStatus": "SUCCESS"
        }
    else:
        return {
            "consistencyStatus": "FAILED"
        }

def perform_data_consistency_check():
    # Placeholder for actual consistency check logic
    # Return True if check passes, False otherwise
    return True
This setup ensures that the downstream Step Function includes a data consistency check before proceeding with further processing. If the consistency check fails, the workflow fails gracefully with a clear error message, allowing for easier troubleshooting and recovery.


You
can event bridge rule defined with a target as steo function invoke ?? how would the Region specific step function can be invoked becuase event brdige is global service but step is not
ChatGPT
ChatGPT
Yes, EventBridge can be configured to invoke a Step Function as a target. To handle the region-specific invocation of Step Functions given that EventBridge is a global service but Step Functions are region-specific, you need to set up EventBridge rules in the specific region where your Step Function resides.

Here’s how you can configure an EventBridge rule to invoke a Step Function in a specific region:

Step-by-Step Configuration
1. Create the Step Function
Ensure you have a Step Function created in the specific region where you want to run your workflow.

2. Create an EventBridge Rule in the Same Region
Create an EventBridge rule in the same AWS region as your Step Function. This rule will listen for specific events (e.g., completion of the upstream ETL process) and invoke the Step Function.

3. Configure EventBridge Rule with Step Function as Target
When defining the EventBridge rule, set the Step Function as the target.

Here is an example of how you can define the EventBridge rule and target using AWS CLI:

bash
Copy code
aws events put-rule \
    --name MyStepFunctionTriggerRule \
    --event-pattern '{"source": ["my.upstream.etl"]}'
4. Add the Step Function as a Target
Add the Step Function as a target for the EventBridge rule. You need to specify the ARN of the Step Function.

bash
Copy code
aws events put-targets \
    --rule MyStepFunctionTriggerRule \
    --targets '[{
        "Id": "1",
        "Arn": "arn:aws:states:us-west-2:123456789012:stateMachine:MyStateMachine",
        "RoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/service-role/EventBridgeInvokeStepFunctionRole"
    }]'
IAM Role for EventBridge to Invoke Step Functions
Ensure you have an IAM role with the necessary permissions to allow EventBridge to invoke the Step Function. Here’s an example of the policy you might need for the role:

json
Copy code
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "states:StartExecution",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:states:us-west-2:123456789012:stateMachine:MyStateMachine"
    }
  ]
}
Handling Cross-Region Invocations
If your upstream ETL process is in a different region, you might need to use EventBridge’s cross-region event bus to route events from one region to another.

Steps for Cross-Region Event Routing
Create an Event Bus in the Target Region:

Create an event bus in the target region where your Step Function resides.
Set Up a Rule in the Source Region:

Create a rule in the source region that sends events to the event bus in the target region.
Rule in the Target Region:

Set up a rule in the target region’s event bus to invoke the Step Function.
Example Configuration for Cross-Region Event Routing
Source Region Rule:

bash
Copy code
aws events put-rule \
    --name ForwardToTargetRegion \
    --event-pattern '{"source": ["my.upstream.etl"]}'
Target Region Event Bus Target:

bash
Copy code
aws events put-targets \
    --rule ForwardToTargetRegion \
    --targets '[{
        "Id": "1",
        "Arn": "arn:aws:events:TARGET_REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:event-bus/target-bus"
    }]'
Target Region Rule to Invoke Step Function:

bash
Copy code
aws events put-rule \
    --event-bus-name target-bus \
    --name InvokeStepFunction \
    --event-pattern '{"source": ["my.upstream.etl"]}'
Add Step Function as Target in Target Region:

bash
Copy code
aws events put-targets \
    --event-bus-name target-bus \
    --rule InvokeStepFunction \
    --targets '[{
        "Id": "1",
        "Arn": "arn:aws:states:TARGET_REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:stateMachine:MyStateMachine",
        "RoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/service-role/EventBridgeInvokeStepFunctionRole"
    }]'
Step Function State Definition with Data Consistency Check
Here is the JSON for the Step Function state definition, ensuring data consistency:

json
Copy code
{
  "Comment": "A Step Function to process ETL with data consistency check",
  "StartAt": "DataConsistencyCheck",
  "States": {
    "DataConsistencyCheck": {

      "Next": "CheckConsistencyResult"
    },
    "CheckConsistencyResult": {
      "Type": "Choice",
      "Choices": [
        {
          "Variable": "$.consistencyStatus",
          "StringEquals": "SUCCESS",
          "Next": "ProcessData"
        },
        {
          "Variable": "$.consistencyStatus",
          "StringEquals": "FAILED",
          "Next": "DataInconsistencyHandler"
        }
      ],
      "Default": "DataInconsistencyHandler"
    },
    "DataInconsistencyHandler": {
      "Type": "Fail",
      "Error": "DataInconsistencyError",
      "Cause": "Data consistency check failed."
    },
    "ProcessData": {
      "Type": "Task",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:us-west-2:123456789012:function:ProcessDataFunction",
      "End": true
    }
  }
}
Summary
By configuring EventBridge to directly invoke the Step Function and ensuring the Step Function includes states for data consistency checks, you can achieve a robust and reliable ETL workflow. Using EventBridge’s ability to route events between regions, you can handle region-specific Step Function invocations effectively.

Data Consistency Check in Step Function
The Step Function should include a state to perform a data consistency check before proceeding with further processing. Here is the JSON for the Step Function state definition:

json
Copy code
{
  "Comment": "A Step Function to process ETL with data consistency check",
  "StartAt": "DataConsistencyCheck",
  "States": {
    "DataConsistencyCheck": {
      "Type": "Task",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:DataConsistencyCheckFunction",
      "Next": "CheckConsistencyResult"
    },
    "CheckConsistencyResult": {
      "Type": "Choice",
      "Choices": [
        {
          "Variable": "$.consistencyStatus",
          "StringEquals": "SUCCESS",
          "Next": "ProcessData"
        },
        {
          "Variable": "$.consistencyStatus",
          "StringEquals": "FAILED",
          "Next": "DataInconsistencyHandler"
        }
      ],
      "Default": "DataInconsistencyHandler"
    },
    "DataInconsistencyHandler": {
      "Type": "Fail",
      "Error": "DataInconsistencyError",
      "Cause": "Data consistency check failed."
    },
    "ProcessData": {
      "Type": "Task",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:ProcessDataFunction",
      "End": true
    }
  }
}
Summary
By configuring EventBridge rules and targets in both regions, you can ensure that your Step Functions are invoked appropriately in the primary region (us-east-1) and can fail over to the secondary region (us-west-1) if necessary. The data consistency check within the Step Function ensures that data is validated before processing, enhancing the reliability of your ETL workflow.

is the forward events above always happens from the us-east-1 event bridge rule or upon failure of the us-east-1 region for message target handling clarify??

ChatGPT
The forwarding of events from us-east-1 to us-west-1 can be set up to handle both scenarios. You can configure the event forwarding to occur always or only upon failure of the us-east-1 region. Here's how you can handle each scenario:

Scenario 1: Always Forward Events for Failover Preparedness
In this approach, events are always forwarded to both the primary and failover regions. This ensures that the failover region is ready to take over processing immediately if the primary region fails.

Primary Region Configuration (us-east-1):
Set up an EventBridge rule to invoke the Step Function in us-east-1.
Configure a rule to forward events to us-west-1 regardless of the primary region's state.
EventBridge Rule in us-east-1
bash
Copy code
aws events put-rule \
    --name InvokePrimaryAndForwardToFailover \
    --event-pattern '{"source": ["my.upstream.etl"]}' \
    --region us-east-1
Add Primary Step Function as Target in us-east-1
bash
Copy code
aws events put-targets \
    --rule InvokePrimaryAndForwardToFailover \
    --targets '[{
        "Id": "1",
        "Arn": "arn:aws:states:us-east-1:123456789012:stateMachine:MyPrimaryStateMachine",
        "RoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/service-role/EventBridgeInvokeStepFunctionRole"
    }]' \
    --region us-east-1
Forward Events to us-west-1
bash
Copy code
aws events put-targets \
    --rule InvokePrimaryAndForwardToFailover \
    --targets '[{
        "Id": "2",
        "Arn": "arn:aws:events:us-west-1:123456789012:event-bus/default",
        "RoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/service-role/EventBridgeInvokeStepFunctionRole"
    }]' \
    --region us-east-1
Failover Region Configuration (us-west-1):
Set up an EventBridge rule to invoke the Step Function when events are forwarded from us-east-1.
EventBridge Rule in us-west-1
bash
Copy code
aws events put-rule \
    --name ListenForFailoverEvents \
    --event-pattern '{"source": ["my.upstream.etl"]}' \
    --region us-west-1
Add Failover Step Function as Target in us-west-1
bash
Copy code
aws events put-targets \
    --rule ListenForFailoverEvents \
    --targets '[{
        "Id": "1",
        "Arn": "arn:aws:states:us-west-1:123456789012:stateMachine:MyFailoverStateMachine",
        "RoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/service-role/EventBridgeInvokeStepFunctionRole"
    }]' \
    --region us-west-1
Scenario 2: Forward Events Only Upon Failure
In this approach, events are forwarded to the failover region only if the primary region fails. This requires monitoring the primary region's health and dynamically forwarding events based on health status.

Primary Region Configuration (us-east-1):
Set up an EventBridge rule to invoke the Step Function in us-east-1.
Configure a health check mechanism to detect failures in us-east-1.
Use a Lambda function to forward events to us-west-1 upon detecting a failure.
EventBridge Rule in us-east-1
bash
Copy code
aws events put-rule \
    --name InvokePrimaryStepFunction \
    --event-pattern '{"source": ["my.upstream.etl"]}' \
    --region us-east-1
Add Primary Step Function as Target in us-east-1
bash
Copy code
aws events put-targets \
    --rule InvokePrimaryStepFunction \
    --targets '[{
        "Id": "1",
        "Arn": "arn:aws:states:us-east-1:123456789012:stateMachine:MyPrimaryStateMachine",
        "RoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/service-role/EventBridgeInvokeStepFunctionRole"
    }]' \
    --region us-east-1
Health Check and Failover Mechanism:
Implement a Lambda function that monitors the health of us-east-1 and forwards events to us-west-1 upon failure.
Lambda Function to Monitor Health and Forward Events
Here’s an example of how you might implement the Lambda function:

python
Copy code
import boto3
import json

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    health_status = check_region_health('us-east-1')
    
    if not health_status:
        forward_event_to_failover(event)

def check_region_health(region):
    # Implement health check logic (e.g., checking CloudWatch alarms, etc.)
    return False  # Simulate a failure for demonstration purposes

def forward_event_to_failover(event):
    eventbridge = boto3.client('events', region_name='us-west-1')
    
    response = eventbridge.put_events(
        Entries=[
            {
                'Source': event['source'],
                'DetailType': event['detail-type'],
                'Detail': json.dumps(event['detail']),
                'EventBusName': 'default'
            }
        ]
    )
    
    return response
Summary
For Scenario 1 (Always Forward Events):

Events are always forwarded from us-east-1 to us-west-1.
Ensures immediate failover readiness but may result in redundant event processing.
For Scenario 2 (Forward Events Only Upon Failure):

Events are forwarded to us-west-1 only upon detecting a failure in us-east-1.
Requires implementing a health check mechanism and potentially a Lambda function to handle failover.
IAM Role for EventBridge to Invoke Step Functions
Ensure the IAM role (EventBridgeInvokeStepFunctionRole) has the necessary permissions:

json
Copy code
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "states:StartExecution",
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:states:us-east-1:123456789012:stateMachine:MyPrimaryStateMachine",
        "arn:aws:states:us-west-1:123456789012:stateMachine:MyFailoverStateMachine"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "events:PutEvents",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:events:us-west-1:123456789012:event-bus/default"
    }
  ]
}
This configuration ensures that your Step Functions are invoked appropriately in both primary and failover scenarios, maintaining the robustness and reliability of your ETL workflow.
