Examples with Real Java Code and How GraalVM Enterprise Edition Optimizes Better than Community Edition
Hereâ€™s an overview of how GraalVM EE optimizes Java code better than GraalVM CE, including examples for aggressive inlining, better escape analysis, improved speculative optimizations, and lower overhead for certain runtime checks.

1. Aggressive Inlining
Example Code:

java
Copy code
public class AggressiveInliningExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AggressiveInliningExample example = new AggressiveInliningExample();
        long startTime = System.nanoTime();
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
            example.method1();
        }
        long endTime = System.nanoTime();
        System.out.println("Execution time: " + (endTime - startTime) + " ns");
    }

    public void method1() {
        method2();
    }

    public void method2() {
        method3();
    }

    public void method3() {
        // Some computation
    }
}
GraalVM EE Advantage:
GraalVM EE performs more aggressive inlining, reducing the overhead of method calls. This can significantly improve performance, especially for deep call chains.

CE vs EE:

CE: May inline only method1 and method2.
EE: May inline method1, method2, and method3 all into the main method, reducing the method call overhead further.
2. Better Escape Analysis
Example Code:

java
Copy code
public class EscapeAnalysisExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        long startTime = System.nanoTime();
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
            createObject();
        }
        long endTime = System.nanoTime();
        System.out.println("Execution time: " + (endTime - startTime) + " ns");
    }

    private static void createObject() {
        Point p = new Point(1, 2);
        // Use p in some way that doesn't escape the method
    }
}

class Point {
    int x, y;
    Point(int x, int y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }
}
GraalVM EE Advantage:
GraalVM EE's improved escape analysis can better determine that the object p does not escape the createObject method and thus can allocate it on the stack instead of the heap.

CE vs EE:

CE: May not optimize the allocation as effectively, potentially leading to more heap allocations.
EE: Better escape analysis leads to more stack allocations, reducing GC pressure and improving performance.
3. Improved Speculative Optimizations
Example Code:

java
Copy code
public class SpeculativeOptimizationsExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        long startTime = System.nanoTime();
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
            double result = Math.sqrt(i);
        }
        long endTime = System.nanoTime();
        System.out.println("Execution time: " + (endTime - startTime) + " ns");
    }
}
GraalVM EE Advantage:
GraalVM EE performs improved speculative optimizations, such as optimizing common paths more aggressively and deoptimizing less frequently.

CE vs EE:

CE: Speculative optimizations may be more conservative, leading to less aggressive performance improvements.
EE: Can speculatively optimize the common path more aggressively, and handle deoptimization more efficiently if the assumptions are invalidated.
4. Lower Overhead for Certain Runtime Checks
Example Code:

java
Copy code
public class RuntimeChecksExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        long startTime = System.nanoTime();
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
            if (checkCondition(i)) {
                // Do something
            }
        }
        long endTime = System.nanoTime();
        System.out.println("Execution time: " + (endTime - startTime) + " ns");
    }

    private static boolean checkCondition(int value) {
        return value % 2 == 0;
    }
}
GraalVM EE Advantage:
GraalVM EE can lower the overhead of runtime checks through more efficient code generation and optimizations.

CE vs EE:

CE: Runtime checks might have higher overhead due to less optimized code paths.
EE: Runtime checks are optimized more aggressively, resulting in lower overhead and better performance.
Performance Comparison
To compare performance, you would typically run these examples using both GraalVM CE and EE and measure the execution times. The EE version is expected to show lower execution times due to the enhanced optimizations.

Conclusion
GraalVM Enterprise Edition provides significant performance advantages over the Community Edition through more aggressive inlining, better escape analysis, improved speculative optimizations, and lower overhead for runtime checks. These optimizations can lead to considerable performance improvements in real-world applications.
